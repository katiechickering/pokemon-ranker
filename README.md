## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

Hello, my name is Katie. This Pokemon ranking app is my final project for Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science course, also known as CS50. This course started my software engineering journey and I am thrilled to share what I learned. I have encorporated Flask, Python, Jinja, jQuery, SQL, HTML, and Bootstrap. into my project to hightlight some of the languages I have learned. My files are organized in an MVC format. I hope you have some fun while ranking your favorite Pokemon!

## ℹ️ Overview

This Pokemon ranking app is my final project for Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science course, also known as CS50. This course started my software engineering journey and I am thrilled to share what I learned. I have incorporated Flask, Python, Jinja, jQuery, SQL, HTML, and Bootstrap into my project to highlight some of the languages I have learned. My files are organized in an MVC format. I hope you have some fun while ranking your favorite Pokemon!


## 🚀 Deployment

To deploy my application, I used Vercel which is a cloud platform for hosting full-stack applications. It syncs with GitHub and updates my project every time I push to the main branch. I used TiDB as the MySQL database host. It integrates with Vercel to make a seamless connection. I included a .sql file and .env.example to show how my database and environment variables are set up.
